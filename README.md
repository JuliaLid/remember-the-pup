## Project Overview and Requirements
* Create a memory game with React. 
* Break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
* The application should render different images to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.
* The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
